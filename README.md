## **Note**
This project was built upon **Brian Winn's** game development course on Coursera. Huge appreciation for his guidance and insights! !!!

## **What was Added**
-  **UI**
-  **New levels**
-  **Music manager** – for new music and loop.
-  **Extra interactivity** – like Pause canva, Smooth, responsive gameplay designed for mobile and more.

## **Overview**
**Box Hunter** is a **fast-paced first-person shooter** set in the depths of space. 
Players must **blast floating crates** to survive—some grant extra time, others boost your score, 
but beware of time-draining traps! With **gravity-defying movement, dynamic box-spawning, and intense time-based challenges**, every round tests precision and strategy.
